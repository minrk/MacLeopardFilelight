This is just a build update to the apparently abandoned macfilelight at
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/macfilelight/
This is a fork of the svn trunk of that project

MinRK's only contributions are updating the XCode project to build for OSX 10.5 and later,
and providing the results of that build.
